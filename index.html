<h2>2009–2013: JJ Project and formation</h2>
<div style="font-size:20px;" class="dabut1stpara">

  <image src="images\jjp.jpg"/>
  
  
<p>
In 2009, JB and Jinyoung were cast into JYP Entertainment after passing open auditions.In 2010, Mark 
and BamBam were respectively scouted by JYP scouts in Los Angeles, USA and Bangkok, Thailand. That same year, 
Yugyeom became a JYP trainee after he was offered an opportunity at his dance school. In December, Jackson passed 
JYP's overseas audition in Hong Kong, but he did not start his training until the summer of 2011.</p>
<p>
JB and Jinyoung, then known by the stage name Junior, made their debut as actors in the 2012 television drama Dream High 2.
 In May, they debuted as the pop duo JJ Project with the single "Bounce".The duo appeared again as actors for the 2013 drama,
 When a Man Falls in Love.</P>
<p>
Meanwhile, Mark, Jackson, BamBam and Yugyeom prepared for their debut together as a group. The quartet made their first television
 appearance on the fourth episode of Mnet's reality-survival program Who is Next: WIN, which aired on September 6, 2013.The seventh 
 and final member to join the group was Youngjae, who had only been a trainee for seven months.</p>

<h2>2014: Debut with Got It?, Got Love, Identify and Around the World</h2>
<div style="font-size:20px;" class="dabut2ndpara">

<img src="images\girlsgirls.gif"/>

<p>
JYP Entertainment announced Got7 on January 1, 2014, debuting their first boy group since 2PM in 2008.A tentative name of the 
group was "Get7" (Korean: 겟세븐), but was changed because it didn't sound good.[12] According to Park Jin-young, "Got7" originated from 
best-selling first-generation group g.o.d, as Park was supposed to debut with them as a six-member mix-gender group and used the working 
name "Got6".[13][14] The final name includes the lucky number seven, meaning "seven lucky people come together".</p>
<p>
Got7 was described as a hip-hop group that incorporates martial arts tricking and b-boying styles in their performances. 
This style drew comparisons to their senior group, 2PM, who are well known for their acrobatic dance styles.Thus, the group 
drew attention even before the official debut and received the nickname "post 2PM".</p>
<p>
Got7 released their first EP, Got It?, on January 20, 2014. The album shot to No. 1 on Billboard's World Albums Chart and
 was No. 2 on the Gaon Album Chart.Got7 made their official music program debut on January 16, 2014, through Mnet's M Countdown, 
 performing their debut single "Girls Girls Girls".Shortly after their debut, the group signed a contract with Japan's Sony Music
 Entertainment and launched a showcase in Japan in front of 9,000 fans. </p>
